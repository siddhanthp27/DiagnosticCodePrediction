# A Neural Machine Translation based Approach for Predicting Medical Procedures using Diagnostic Sequences

Automating diagnosis coding is a predictive healthcare application that involves building predictive models for large-scale patient data. Here, I have coded an approach for automatically predicting suitable diagnostic procedures given patientsâ€™ medical records. I viewed the problem as one of Neural Machine Translation, where we translate the sequence from the diagnoses space to the procedure space.
